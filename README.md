pad_game.py is a simulation of the mobile game Puzzle and Dragons game engine using Pygame (see https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zCX-Tz8KpXE for the actual game)

pad_dqn.py uses a Deep-Q Network (DQN) to maximize the number of combos made. Uses experience replay, 
and trains action values using the Bellman equation
